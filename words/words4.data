MapR And Informatica Announce Joint Support To Deliver High Performance Big Data Integration And Analysis
Combination Makes Moving High Volume Transaction, Interaction and Real-time Streaming Data into Hadoop a Reality

SAN JOSE, Calif. and REDWOOD CITY, Calif. – March 5, 2012 – MapR Technologies, Inc., a provider of next generation distribution for Apache Hadoop and Informatica Corporation (NASDAQ: INFA), the world’s number one independent provider of data integration software, today announced joint support for MapR’s distribution for Hadoop with the Informatica Platform. In addition, Informatica HParser Community Edition which is available for free, will be available for download as part of the MapR distribution from the MapR website. The MapR distribution is also available through the EMC Greenplum MR Edition and Cisco UCS.

By using MapR and Informatica together, organizations will now be able to perform high performance data integration, replication and messaging. Together the two companies can push the limits of high performance networks and move many terabytes per hour of transaction, interaction and streaming data into MapR, as well as parse and process a broad range of structured and unstructured data natively in Hadoop, all without coding.

“As the big data ecosystem continues to grow more holistic, data management practices are needed to address the challenges of information volume, variety, velocity and complexity,” said Merv Adrian, research vice president, Gartner Research. “Coupling advanced data management practices is the next step organizations need to take as they build a platform that expands the breadth and depth of applications.”
