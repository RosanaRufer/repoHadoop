repoHadoop
==========

This repo helps me save me some work uploading MapReduce applications to the remote machine I use to connect to Hadoop, where I've initizalized a git repository.

I thought also about the idea of uploading big data files but unfortunately GitHub allows maximum 100MB files and the files we're processing on Hadoop are up to GB and TB...so... NO way xD.
